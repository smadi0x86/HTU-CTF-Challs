HTU CTF Challenges
==================

This repository contains a comprehensive set of original Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges developed for educational purposes. The challenges span multiple cybersecurity domains and are organized into categories:

- pwn: binary exploitation, memory corruption, shellcoding
- reverse: reverse engineering, static/dynamic analysis
- crypto: cryptographic puzzles and breakable implementations
- web: web exploitation, logic flaws, authentication bypasses
- forensics: steganography, PCAP analysis, metadata, and image recovery
- misc: hash cracking, encoding puzzles, logic-based tasks

Each challenge folder includes relevant files, Dockerfiles (where needed), and solutions or writeups in many cases. These tasks are designed to test a wide range of offensive security skills, from beginner to advanced.

Originally created for academic use, these challenges remain a valuable resource for CTF practice, training and self-study.

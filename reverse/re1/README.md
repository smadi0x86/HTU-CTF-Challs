# RE1

Description:

Reverse Engineering is a pretty fun category that consists of figuring out what compiled binaries do. It's useful in fields like Vulnerability Research, Malware Analysis, and so much more. Here's a fun little intro :)

Hint 1: I wonder how I might be able to figure out what _strings_ a file has in it
Hint 2: What are all those H's doing there? I sure didn't put them there

## Solution

You can solve the challenge by running strings on a file and finding the strings contained in it, which when put together end up comprising the flag: `HTU{I_c4n_f1nd_4_str1ng_silly}`
